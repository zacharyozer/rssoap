We appropriated the javascript animation without proper license.
Since this is an academic project and not a commercial venture,
and since we do not anticipate this ever seeing the light of day,
we feel that obtaining appropriate license for this plugin is a
little bit of overkill. Also, we don't have time right now.
Should we anticipate any further use of either this application 
or this view, we will either obtain an appropriate license or 
rewrite the code ourselves.
